Hi, I'm Ziv Hochman ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m a highly motivated Master's student in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at Utrecht University, with a strong foundation in computer science and hands-on experience as a full stack developer. My technical skill set spans Python, Java, ReactJS, TypeScript, Node.js, and AWS, and Iâ€™ve applied these technologies in both academic research and real-world projects. Currently, Iâ€™m conducting research on human-centered AI for climate adaptation, combining data science with impactful societal applications. I thrive in collaborative environments, value continuous learning, and enjoy translating complex data into meaningful insights. I'm now looking to bring my passion for innovation and problem-solving to dynamic projects where I can make a real contribution.
